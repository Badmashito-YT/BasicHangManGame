# BasicHangManGame
This is a simple hangman game. I created this game using python programming langage.
The concepts used in this program are:- File handling, if-else conditions, while loop & random module.
If you are  a beginner check the code nicely and try to implement/make it any preferred language(like:- c,c++,java,etc..).
